 * You’re not required to implement any of the methods in AppGlideModule for the API to be generated. You can leave the class blank as long as it extends AppGlideModule and is annotated with @GlideModule.
 * <p>
 * AppGlideModule implementations must always be annotated with @GlideModule. If the annotation is not present, the module will not be discovered and you will see a warning in your logs with the Glide log tag that indicates that the module couldn’t be found.

 * Note: Libraries should not include AppGlideModule implementations. See the configuration page for details.
